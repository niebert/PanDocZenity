	abstract = {Ninety percent (56/62) of sentinel chickens introduced to two regions within the Italian Alps seroconverted to West Nile virus {(WNV)} during the summer of 2005, showing a range of antibody titres from 1/20 to 1/320 in a virus neutralization test. Neutralization specificity for {WNV} antibodies was confirmed on an additional 34 sera that were tested in parallel against {WNV} (16/34 seropositivity), Usutu virus (3/34 seropositivity) and Koutango virus. The geometric mean neutralizing titre {(GMT)} calculated for {WN-specific} antibodies was 33.68 and did not differ significantly amongst sample sites, although the overall results indicate more active circulation of {WNV} at the higher elevations. Such high levels of seroconversion raise the possibility that many chickens may have been exposed to virus via routes other than mosquito transmission. No chickens or any other local animals were associated with illness due to {WNV} implying that {WNV}, and to a much lower extent Usutu virus, circulate harmlessly amongst wildlife species in northern Italy from late May onwards until early autumn.},

This paper explores whether 51 rural Access to Allied Psychological Services projects, funded under the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program, are improving such access, and, if so, whether this is translating to positive consumer outcomes. Design and method: The paper draws on three data sources (a survey of models of service delivery, a minimum dataset and three case studies) to examine the operation and achievements of these projects, and makes comparisons with their 57 urban equivalents as relevant. Results: Proportionally, uptake of the projects in rural areas has been higher than in urban areas: more {GPs} and allied health professionals are involved, and more consumers have received care. There is also evidence that the models of service delivery used in these projects have specifically been designed to resolve issues particular to rural areas, such as difficulties recruiting and retaining providers. The projects are being delivered at no or low cost to consumers, and are achieving positive outcomes as assessed by standardised measures. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the rural projects have the potential to improve access to mental health care for rural residents with depression and anxiety, by enabling {GPs} to refer them to allied health professionals. The findings are discussed with reference to recent reforms to mental health care delivery in Australia.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The Western Tick-borne encephalitis {(TBE)} virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human {TBE} cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new {TBE} foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain {TBE} upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified. {METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS:} In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of {TBE} in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where {TBE} has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical {TBE} cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in {TBE} incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer. {CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE:} Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main {TBE} reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western {TBE} virus and, consequently, the risk of {TBE} emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting {TBE} risk on a wider scale.},

In Europe, {LB} is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Recent surveys show that the overall prevalence of {LB} may be stabilising, but its geographical distribution is increasing. In addition, much remains to be discovered about the factors affecting genospecific prevalence, transmission and virulence, although avoidance of tick bite still appears to be the most efficient preventive measure. Uniform, European-wide surveillance programmes (particularly on a local scale) and standardisation of diagnostic tests and treatments are still urgently needed, especially in the light of climate change scenarios and land-use and socio-economic changes. Improved epidemiological knowledge will also aid development of more accurate risk prediction models for {LB.} Studies on the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem changes on {LB} emergence may identify new paradigms for the prevention and control of {LB} and other tick-borne diseases.},

Ticks were pooled for analyses and from 1060 pools of ticks collected in the province of Belluno and 12390 tick samples collected in Trentino, four proved positive by immunofluorescence microscopy using a tick-borne encephalitis {(TBE)-specific} antiserum. The identity of the virus isolates was determined by {RT-PCR} cycle sequencing and they were all found to be closely similar ({\textgreater} 98\% nucleotide identity) to typical western European {TBE} complex viruses as found in Austria. The isolates from Trentino differed from the Neudorfl strain of western European {TBE} virus at eight nucleotide positions but as these nucleotide substitutions were all synonymous, there were no amino acid changes. These results imply that the virus isolates in Trentino have changed slightly from the typical European strains isolated in nearby Austria. The abundance of questing ticks and ticks feeding on roe deer was greater in {TBE} positive hunting districts than in hunting districts where {TBE} complex viruses were only probable or believed to be absent. In {TBE} positive and probable districts synchrony in the seasonal dynamics of larvae and nymphs of L. ricinus was observed. This study provides evidence to suggest that roe deer may have an important role to play in the maintenance of tick density and in the persistence of {TBE} virus.},

Ticks were more abundant at altitudes below 1,300 m a.s.l., in the presence of limestone and vegetation cover with thermophile deciduous forests and high densities of roe deer. A bootstrap aggregation procedure (bagging) was used to produce a model for the prediction of tick occurrence, the accuracy of which was tested on actual tick counts assessed by a further dragging campaign carried out during 1997 to determine infection prevalence and resulted in average 77\%. Other tests of the model were made on additional and independent data sets. The prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l, determined by polymerase chain reaction on 2,208 nymphs collected by random dragging in 245 transects selected within eight areas where the model predicted the occurrence of I. ricinus during 1997, was 17.5\% and was positively correlated to tick abundance and roe deer density. These findings were used to relate the output of the bagged model (probability of tick occurrence) to the density of infected nymphs through a stepwise model selection procedure and thus to produce a {GIS} digital map of the probability distribution of infected nymphs in the Province of Trento at high resolution scale (50 by 50-m cell resolution). The application of the bagging procedure increased the accuracy of the prediction made by a single classification tree, a well-known classification method for the analysis of epidemiological data.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} Foundry is an industry involved various kinds of metals and chemicals. Workers who work in foundry industry are at risk of exposure to these metals and chemicals. Objective of this study was to conduct quantitative health risk assessment for workers who exposed to metals from an aluminium production industry. {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHOD} The {U.S.} National Academy of Sciences' four steps of health risk assessment were used to conduct quantitative health risk assessment in this study. {RESULTS} This study showed that there were 6 types of metals involved in the aluminium foundry in this study. These metals could cause various health effects but not cancers. Workers were mostly exposed to these metals by inhalation. Calculated reference dose {(RfD)} for inhalation of aluminium used in this assessment was 0.000015 mg/kg/day. Calculated {RID} for inhalation of manganese used in this assessment was 0.000002 mg/kg/day. Calculated {RfD} for inhalation of copper used in this assessment was 0.000028 mg/kg/day. Calculated {RID} for inhalation of zinc used in this assessment was 0.000083 mg/ kg/day. Calculated {RID} for inhalation of magnesium used in this assessment was 0.949833 mg/kg/day. Calculated {RID} for inhalation of iron used in this assessment was 10.6219 mg/kg/day. Maximum daily doses {(MDDs)} for workers who exposed to metals measured in this foundry were 0, 0, 0.000463, 0.0000927, 0.000162 and 0 mg/kg/day for manganese, zinc, aluminium, iron, magnesium and copper, respectively. Finally, risk characterization for workers exposed to metals in this aluminium foundry showed that workers in this foundry had 31 times higher risk of developing diseases from aluminium than persons who were not exposed to aluminium. These workers had the same risk of developing diseases from other metals and chemicals as persons who were not exposed to those metals and chemicals. {CONCLUSION} Workers who exposed to aluminium in this aluminium production plant had 31 times risk of developing non-carcinogenic effects from aluminium compared with normal persons. Therefore, appropriate preventive measures should be applied to protect workers.},

	abstract = {Tick-borne encephalitis {(TBE)} is a severe disease that has been endemic in north-east Italy since 1992. Over the past two decades, there has been an increase in the number of human cases reported in many European countries, including Italy. To assess the current {TBE} infection risk, questing ticks were collected from known {TBE} foci, as well as from a site in northern Italy where no human infections have been reported previously. A total of 1739 Ixodes ricinus (1485 nymphs and 254 adults) was collected and analysed for {TBEV} prevalence by a real-time {RT-PCR} targeting the 3' untranslated region. Phylogenetic analyses of the partial envelope gene were conducted on two newly sequenced {TBE} virus {(TBEV)} strains and 28 previously published sequences to investigate the genealogical relationships of the circulating {TBEV} strains. These phylogenetic analyses confirmed a previous report that the European {TBEV} subtype is the only subtype circulating within the {TBE} foci in north-east Italy. Interestingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a high degree of divergence (mean 2.54 \%) between the {TBEV} strains recovered in the Italian province of Trento, despite the circulation of a single {TBEV} subtype. This elevated genetic variability within a single {TBE} focus may reflect local differences in the long-standing evolutionary dynamics of {TBEV} at this site relative to previously characterized sites, or more recent and continuous reintroduction of various {TBEV} strains.},

Geospatial data can include socioeconomic, environmental, geophysical, and technical data about the Earth and societal infrastructure and it is pivotal in environmental modelling and management {(EMM).} Desktop, web-based, and embedded geospatial systems have become an essential part of {EMM}, providing pre- or post-processing of geospatial data, analysis and visualisation of results or a graphical user interface {(GUI).} Many local, regional, national, and international efforts are underway to create geospatial data infrastructures and tools for viewing and using geospatial data. When environmental attribute data is linked to these infrastructures, powerful tools for environmental management are instantly created. The growing culture of free/libre and open source software {(FOSS)} provides an alternative approach to software development for the field of {GIS} {(FOSS4G).} To provide an overview of {FOSS4G} for {EMM}, we analyse platforms, software stacks, and {EMM} workflows. In the {FOSS} world the barriers to interoperability are low and thus the software stack tends to be thicker than in the proprietary platform. The {FOSS4G} world thrives on the evolution of software stacks and platforms. We provide examples of software stacks built from current {FOSS4G} that support {EMM} workflows and highlight the advantages of {FOSS4G} solutions including opportunities to redistribute resulting modelling tools freely to end-users and to support general goals of openness and transparency with respect to modelling tools.},

Tick-borne encephalitis {(TBE)}, which is transmitted by co-feeding of larvae and nymphs on rodents, requires precise climatic conditions to occur. We used roe deer as sentinels for potential circulation of {TBE} virus in Northern Italy, by examining the association between tick infestation, occurrence of {TBE} human cases, geographical and climatic parameters. Tick infestation on roe deer, and particularly frequency of co-feeding, was clearly associated with the geographic location and the autumnal cooling rate. Consistently, {TBE} occurrence in humans was geographically related to co-feeding tick abundance. The surveillance of tick infestation on roe deer, combined with remotely sensed climatic data, could therefore be used as an inexpensive early risk assessment tool of favourable conditions for {TBE} emergence and persistence in humans.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive analytical review of the risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication approaches currently being undertaken by key national, provincial/state, territorial, and international agencies was conducted. The information acquired for review was used to identify the differences, commonalities, strengths, and weaknesses among the various approaches, and to identify elements that should be included in an effective, current, and comprehensive approach applicable to environmental, human health and occupational health risks. More than 80 agencies, organizations, and advisory councils, encompassing more than 100 risk documents, were examined during the period from February 2000 until November 2002. An overview was made of the most important general frameworks for risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication for human health and ecological risk, and for occupational health risk. In addition, frameworks for specific applications were reviewed and summarized, including those for (1)contaminated sites; (2) northern contaminants; (3) priority substances; (4) standards development; (5) food safety; (6) medical devices; (7) prescription drug use; (8) emergency response; (9) transportation; (10) risk communication. Twelve frameworks were selected for more extensive review on the basis of representation of the areas of human health, ecological, and occupational health risk; relevance to Canadian risk management needs; representation of comprehensive and well-defined approaches; generalizability with their risk areas; representation of "state of the art" in Canada, the United States, and/or internationally; and extent of usage of potential usage within Canada. These 12 frameworks were: 1. Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management {(US} {Presidential/Congressional} Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997). 2. Health Risk Determination: The Challenge of Health Protection {(Health} and Welfare Canada, 1990). 3. Health Canada {Decision-Making} Framework for Identifying, Assessing and Managing Health Risks {(Health} Canada, 2000). 4. Canadian Environmental Protection Act: Human Health Risk Assessment of Priority {Substances(Health} Canada, 1994). 5. {CSA-Q8550} Risk Management: Guidelines for {Decision-Makers} {(Canada} Standards Association, 1997). 6. Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process {(US} National Research Council, 1983). 7. Understanding Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society {(US} National Research Council, 1996). 8. Environmental Health Risk Assessment {(enHealth} Council of Australia, 2002). 9. A Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment {(CCME}, 1996). 10. Ecological Risk Assessments of Priority Substances Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act {(Environment} Canada, 1996).11. Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment {(US} {EPA}, 1998b). 12. Proposed Model for Occupational Health Risk Assessment and Management {(Rampal} \& Sadhra, 1999). Based on the extensive review of these frameworks, seven key elements that should be included in a comprehensive framework for human health, ecological, and occupational risk assessment and management were identified: 1. Problem formulation stage. 2. Stakeholder involvement. 3. Communication. 4. Quantitative risk assessment components. 5. Iteration and evaluation. 6. Informed decision making. 7. Flexibility. On the basis of this overarching approach to risk management, the following "checklist" to ensure a good risk management decision is proposed: - Make sure you're solving the right problem. - Consider the problem and the risk within the full context of the situation, using a broad perspective. - Acknowledge, incorporate, and balance the multiple dimensions of risk. - Ensure the highest degree of reliability for all components of the risk management process. - Involve interested and effected parties from the outset of the process. - Commit to honest and open communication between all parties. - Employ continuous evaluation throughout the process (formative, process, and outcome evaluation), and be prepared to change the decision if new information becomes available. Comprehensive and sound principles are critical to providing structure and integrity to risk management frameworks. Guiding principles are intended to provide an ethical grounding for considering the many factors involved in risk management decision making. Ten principles are proposed to guide risk management decision making. The first four principles were adapted and modified from Hattis (1996) along with the addition of two more principles by Hrudey (2000). These have been supplemented by another four principles to make the 10 presented. The principles are based in fundamental ethical principles and values. These principles are intended to be aspirational rather than prescriptive--their application requires flexibility and practical judgement. Risk management is inherently a process in search of balance among competing interests and concerns. Each risk management decision will be "balancing act" of competing priorities, and trade-offs may sometimes have to be made between seemingly conflicting principles. The 10 decision-making principles, with the corresponding ethical principle in italics are: 1. Do more good than harm (beneficence, nonmalificence).- The ultimate goal of good risk management is to prevent or minimize risk, or to "do good" as much as possible. 2. Fair process of decision making (fairness, natural justice). - Risk management must be just, equitable, impartial, unbiased, dispassionate, and objective as far as possible given the circumstances of each situation. 3. Ensure an equitable distribution of risk (equity). - An equitable process of risk management would ensure fair outcomes and equal treatment of all concerned through an equal distribution of benefits and burdens (includes the concept of distributive justice, i.e., equal opportunities for all individuals). 4. Seek optimal use of limited risk management resources (utility). - Optimal risk management demands using limited resources where they will achieve the most risk reduction of overall benefit. 5. Promise no more risk management that can be delivered (honesty).- Unrealistic expectations of risk management can be avoided with honest and candid public accounting of what we know and don't know, and what we can and can't do using risk assessment and risk management. 6. Impose no more risk that you would tolerate yourself (the Golden Rule). - The Golden Rule is important in risk management because it forces decision makers to abandon complete detachment from their decisions so they may understand the perspectives of those affected. 7. Be cautious in the face of uncertainty ("better safe than sorry"). - Risk management must adopt a cautious approach when faced with a potentially serous risk, even if the evidence is uncertain. 8. Foster informed risk decision making for all stakeholders (autonomy). - Fostering autonomous decision making involves both providing people with the opportunity to participate, and full and honest disclosure of all the information required for informed decisions. 9. Risk management processes must be flexible and evolutionary to be open to new knowledge and understanding (evolution, evaluation, iterative process). - The incorporation of new evidence requires that risk management be a flexible, evolutionary, and iterative process, and that evaluation is employed at the beginning and througthout the process. 10. the complete elimination fo risk is not possible (life is not risk free).- Risk is pervasive in our society, and cannot be totally eliminated despite an oft-expressed public desire for "zero risk". However, the level of risk that may ve tolerable by any individual is dependent on values of beliefs, as well as scientific information. Each agency must continue to employ a process that meets the needs of their specific application of risk management. A single approach cannot satisfy the diverse areas to which risk decisions are being applied. However, with increasing experience in the application of the approaches, we are evolving to a common understanding of the essential elements and principles required for successful risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. Risk management will continue to be a balancing act of competing priorities and needs. Flexibility and good judgement are ultimately the key to successfully making appropriate risk decisions.},

In order to establish the state estimation function, pseudo- measurements need to be introduced. As there is generalised uncertainty in the power demand, the load characteristics can be utilised to appropriately model the pseudo-measurements. This paper proposes two new approaches for modelling pseudo-measurements for the purpose of distribution system state estimation; the first is based on correlation and the second is based on load probability density functions.},

Characteristics of the concept were analysed and compared with those of current animal health care strategies for disease risk identification and herd health management, insurance, and certification. {HACCP} is a hybrid strategy of quality control at both production process and product level. Animal health is considered a particular quality feature. We show that process control (expressed in terms of controlling both general and specific disease risk factors) and product control (expressed in terms of testing animals or animal products for specific disease agents) could form the basis for improving animal health. We conclude that {HACCP} provides ample opportunity for preventive health action and risk management at a relatively low cost in terms of labour, finance and documentation expenditure, at both the farm and sector level. Epidemiological field studies are currently needed to identify critical control points and to design {HACCP} procedures for livestock producers. In the long run, {HACCP} based animal health care can be further developed into a quality control systems approach to cover all aspects that are related, either directly or indirectly, to animal health.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The} continuing spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus in Europe is of increasing public health concern due to the potential risk of new outbreaks of exotic vector-borne diseases that this species can transmit as competent vector. We predicted the most favorable areas for a short term invasion of Ae. albopictus in north-eastern Italy using reconstructed daily satellite data time series {(MODIS} Land Surface Temperature maps, {LST).} We reconstructed more than 11,000 daily {MODIS} {LST} maps for the period 2001-09 (i.e. performed spatial and temporal gap-filling) in an Open Source {GIS} framework. We aggregated these {LST} maps over time and identified the potential distribution areas of Ae. albopictus by adapting published temperature threshold values using three variables as predictors (0 degree C for mean January temperatures, 11 degree C for annual mean temperatures and 1350 growing degree days filtered for areas with autumnal mean temperatures {\textgreater} 11 degree C ). The resulting maps were integrated into the final potential distribution map and this was compared with the known current distribution of Ae. albopictus in north-eastern {Italy.RESULTS:LST} maps show the microclimatic characteristics peculiar to complex terrains, which would not be visible in maps commonly derived from interpolated meteorological station data. The patterns of the three indicator variables partially differ from each other, while winter temperature is the determining limiting factor for the distribution of Ae. albopictus. All three variables show a similar spatial pattern with some local differences, in particular in the northern part of the study area (upper Adige {valley).CONCLUSIONS:Reconstructed} daily land surface temperature data from satellites can be used to predict areas of short term invasion of the tiger mosquito with sufficient accuracy (200 m pixel resolution size). Furthermore, they may be applied to other species of arthropod of medical interest for which temperature is a relevant limiting factor. The results indicate that, during the next few years, the tiger mosquito will probably spread toward northern latitudes and higher altitudes in north-eastern Italy, which will considerably expand the range of the current distribution of this species.},

The overall hantavirus seroprevalence in the bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus (n=229) screened for Puumala virus {(PUUV)} antibodies was 0.4\%, and that for Apodemus flavicollis mice (n=1416) screened for Dobrava virus {(DOBV)} antibodies was 0.2\%. Antibodies against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus {(LCMV)} were found in 82 (5.6\%) of the 1472 tested rodents; the seroprevalence being 6.1\% in A. flavicollis (n=1181), 3.3\% in C. glareolus (n=276), and 14.3\% in Microtus arvalis (n=7).

	abstract = {The tiger mosquito {(Aedes} albopictus), vector of several emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies. To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data {(MODIS} Land Surface Temperature: {LST)} and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the {0°C} {LST} threshold for January mean temperatures and the {11°C} threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and {1°C}, respectively. {MODIS} satellite {LST} data are useful for accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas, predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas.},

Harvesting records of rock partridge {(Alectoris} graeca saxatilis) were examined first to identify the presence of cycles in a species with a southern European distribution and then to examine synchrony between populations at a range of scales. 2. Hunting records from 1965 to 1994 were obtained from 210 hunting areas and analysed at three spatial scales: subpopulation, population and metapopulation. Rock partridge exhibited cyclic fluctuations in about 40\% of the time series with a period of 4-7 years. The results did not change with spatial scale. The density-dependent structure of the populations showed that most populations exhibited damped oscillations. 3. The proportion of populations that were in synchrony increased with scale from the population to metapopulation level. There was no decline in synchrony with distance but a large variation between populations irrespective of distance. 4. The populations clustered into dry and wet habitats, with those in the dry habitat being more cyclic. We suggest the lack of spatial synchrony with distance but greater synchrony within habitats may reflect the influence of stochastic events operating on populations with different density dependence structures.},
